WARNING - do not use this software or connect this to your systems.  I do not know what I am doing and it may fry your c64 and void its warranty.  If you do understand electronics please review the firmware code and make your own mind up.

Load the uno2tap_fw.ino firmware onto the Arduino

Connect the Arduino pins to the cassette port of the C64:

Pin 3 - Read
Pin 4 - Write
Pin 5 - Sense

I've been using crocodile clips but a better connector should be devised.

You can change the pin numbers using the defines at the top of uno2tap_fw.ino.

The cassette port pin locations are explained here:

http://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/Cassette_Port

Connect the Arduino to the PC via USB.

The uno2tap server software is written in Java.  It has been tested on Linux but should also run on Windows and MacOS.  Adapt the 'uno2tap' shell script for your system - Java needs to be able to find the RxTx library which is usually installed along with the Arduino IDE.  There is info about using the library at:

http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Java

The arguments to uno2tap are:

-dev <serial device name> 	- The serial device that the Arduino presents as - If you don't specify this option some defaults will be tried.
-tap <tap image>		- Specify the tap image file to use.  If it does not exist a new one is created for recording over.

Once uno2tap is connected and running, press shift and run-stop on the c64 and type 'play' in the uno2tap console.  Type 'help' in the console for other commands.

Make sure that you backup your precious taps before recording over any of them.


Issues

The timing is really tight.  It works on Linux so long as the PC isn't too busy with anything else.  Windows and MacOS with different serial/USB drivers may be different.

There's no cassette motor sense so the tape can't be automatically paused.  At the start of loading hold down the C= key so that the c64 doesn't pause at the FOUND X stage.

There are some dodgy versions of the RxTx library that crash with this and also the Arduino IDE serial monitor.  Switching to a different librxtx.so fixed this for me.
